                    <p>Create a single HTML web page for a subject you like (e.g. personal home page, photo collection,
                        movie stars, cars etc.). You can NOT use any CSS or Javascript on your web page! Only basic HTML
                        language. The web page should be HTML5 valid. You will have to use the following HTML tags in
                        your web page:
                        &lt;img&gt;,&lt;a&gt;,&lt;table&gt;,&lt;br&gt;,&lt;hr&gt;,&lt;p&gt;,&lt;b&gt;,&lt;div&gt;,&lt;ul&gt;,
                        &lt;li&gt;,&lt;section&gt;,&lt;article&gt;,&lt;footer&gt;,&lt;header&gt;,&lt;aside&gt;,&lt;nav&gt;,
                        &lt;svg&gt;,&lt;audio&gt;,&lt;video&gt;,&lt;figure&gt;,&lt;figcaption&gt;,&lt;main&gt;. Also you
                        should specify the type of document using &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;. The page must be at least one screen
                        long and at most 2 screens long (using a resolution of 1024x768 pixels). The textual content of
                        the page should be relevant to the chosen subject (not "lorem ipsum" text).
                        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This single web page can be edited using any editor you want and can be
                        presented on any browser you prefer.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Develop a web site using CSS in which you should use various text effects like: - text glowing
                        (i.e. white ambiental light illuminating the text) - text shadowing - text on fire - underline
                        effect for each letter of a word.

                        Write a web page which contains a vertical menu that mimics the "windows start menu". The
                        menu is vertical and each menu item can contain a sumbenu in the right side and each item from
                        that submenu can also expand (when the mouse is over it) to a submenu on the right side and so
                        on..</p>

                    <p>Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://www.amazon.com/.
                        You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html
                        document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added
                        (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.) and you are not allowed to use any css or javascript
                        library.</p>

                        when the user clicks the first button the page's background will change (there are 5 background
                        images which are rotated, one at a time) and when the user clicks the second button the shape
                        and color of all the links from the document will change.</p>

                        development version, jquery.js); YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER JS LIBRARY, PLUGIN OR
                        EXTENSION BESIDES THE JQUERY LIBRARY. Write a web page which displays a vertically sliding
                        desktop like the ones used on the Android or iOS. The web page should have 4 desktops, each
                        desktop having a distinct transparent background color or image and having distinct textual and
                        image content. A desktop is a large div occupying (exactly or almost) the whole browser window.
                        By default, desktop no. 1 should be shown to the user. If the user clicks somewhere on the
                        desktop the desktop should be slide vertically to the bottom of the window and from the top of
                        the window desktop no. 2 should slide vertically and occupy the whole browser window. Desktop
                        sliding should be an animated transition and one desktop should not just instantly dissapear and
                        the next desktop be displayed instead.</p>

                        information about a document in the database (i.e. author, title, number of pages, type, format
                        etc.). The application should implement: document browsing (use AJAX for retrieving documents of
                        a specific type or format), adding, removing and updating a document. Also, on the browsing
                        page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. type or format), should be
                        displayed (do this in javascript).</p>

                        problem you need to solve for this lab will be the same problem you had for Lab7 (PHP, Ajax,
                        JSON), the backend of the solution will be the same (i.e. the php code), but you have to change
                        the frontend (html, css, javascript part) to be an Angular application.</p>

                        requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in
                        cookies/session objects. Write a web application for a forum. Users must identify themselfs
                        prior to entering the forum. Each user can start a new topic or can comment (post) on an
                        existing topic. Each user must be able to delete its own posts (comments). The posts of a topic
                        should be displayed in a single web page.</p>
